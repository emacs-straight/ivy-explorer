Provides a large more easily readable grid for file browsing using
https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper[ivy].

Users can navigate the grid using kbd:[Ctrl-f], kbd:[Ctrl-b],
kbd:[Ctrl-n], kbd:[Ctrl-p]. By pressing kbd:[,] users can enter
directories or open files on the screen using
https://github.com/abo-abo/avy/[avy]. Pressing kbd:[;] will jump to
the selected candidate and invoke the dipsatch action dialog. This
works because those characters are rarely used for file search. If you
have to input them you can still use kbd:[C-q ,], kbd:[C-q ;].

Heavily inspired by
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LustyExplorer[LustyExplorer].
